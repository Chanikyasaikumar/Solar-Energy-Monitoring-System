**Solar Energy Monitoring and Forecasting System**
‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Energy Monitoring and Forecasting SystemA full-stack web application designed to help residential users optimize energy consumption by providing real-time solar panel data and predictive power output forecasting. This project showcases proficiency in API integration, data visualization, and machine learning principles.


‚ú® Key Features & Achievements
High Accuracy Forecasting: Integrated specialized libraries (pvlib) and external weather APIs to calculate real-time solar irradiance, achieving $90\%$ accuracy in daily power forecasts.
Data-Driven Optimization: Designed interactive Plotly dashboards visualizing $5+$ key metrics, empowering users to make decisions that could lead to significant electricity bill reductions.
Full-Stack Analytics: Developed a system using Python/Flask, MySQL, and Pandas for robust data processing, authentication, appliance tracking, and dynamic billing calculation
.Production Deployment: Successfully configured and deployed the application to a cloud environment (Render), demonstrating mastery of the full CI/CD pipeline setup.
